      <h2>Proposition: [Renewable energy has rapidly grown over the past two decades, gradually replacing fossil fuels as the leading source of global electricity generation]</h2>

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

          <figcaption>Line plot representing the rapid growth of renwable energy generatio and fossil fuels (2000-2022).</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The line graph was employed to show the annual growth trends of renewable energy compared to fossil fuels, which also indicate the growing growth of renewable energy.</li>
          <li>Including legends allows the viewer to easily view key points, such as the rapid increase in renewable energy and the leveling off of fossil fuels, thus providing it with more contexts</li>
          <li>It is simple to differentiate visually between the two using purple for renewable and blue for fossil fuels, which makes reading easier and emphasizes the difference between their growth patterns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

          <figcaption>Stacked Area Chart; comparing global electricity generation for renwable energy and fossil fuels (2000-2022).</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The stacked area chart effectively shows the cumulative growth of renewable energy and fossil fuels over time, allowing for an easy comparison of their growth.</li>
          <li>The grid enhances the readability of the chart by allowing viewers to easily track values across both axes, improving the accuracy of data interpretation. It provides a clear structure that helps viewers compare the growth of renewable energy and fossil fuels over time.</li>
          <li>The chart’s cumulative representation demonstrates the overall growth of renewable energy and the decline of fossil fuel reliance, showcasing the transition in global electricity generation.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p> In my design process, I aimed to graphically illustrate powerful and convincing evidence of the reality that renewable energy is rising steadily and progressively dominating fossil fuels as the major source of global electricity production. The supporting proposition line graph, comparing the increase in renewable energy over time to fossil fuels, was relatively simple to make because it easily displays this trend in a straightforward, easy-to-read format. The stacked area chart in the opposing proposition was a more subtle challenge. Although it depicts the cumulative growth of renewable energy, it also indicates that fossil fuels remain the dominant players in the world electricity generation mix, despite the growth of renewables. This visual tension sets up a richer ethical thought that, while the supporting chart depicts a distinctive trend of the ascendancy of renewable energy, the area chart highlights the persistent dominance of fossil fuels.</p>
        <p> The ethical analysis of visualization is now more complex than I initially realized. It's clear that even a well-constructed graph can be misleading if it doesn't present the entire picture of a situation. For example, even though renewable power is growing incredibly rapidly, the area chart shows that fossil fuels still predominate in the energy mix, which might make viewers conclude that the transition to renewables is slower than it appears. In terms of distinguishing "acceptable" persuasive choices from "misleading" ones, the answer is honesty; either graph can be convincing, but their moral credibility depends on whether they provide the full picture to draw appropriate conclusions. Don't cherry-pick data points or selectively emphasize trends that mislead the viewer.
